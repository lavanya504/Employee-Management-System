#Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a Spring Boot app with MySQL and Thymeleaf, featuring role-based login for Admins and Employees. Admins manage employee records, while employees view their details. It organizes data into Personal, Professional, Project, and Finance sections, supports validation, and allows payslip downloads.
